## How to play

The operation of this game is very similar to the operation of a naval battle game, the movement of the pieces is done through the coordinates that you pass on the console.

For example, if you want to move the first white pawn, you will have to write its coordinates, which in this case is a2, and press enter, right after, write the destination coordinate, which must be chosen respecting the movement limitations of each piece.

NOTE: you must first write the letter of the column (in lower case) and then the line number.
